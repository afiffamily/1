# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Language

**All code comments, docstrings, commit messages and user-facing strings are in Uzbek (Latin script).** Match that — a comment or bot reply in English reads as foreign here. Comments explain *why*, especially the non-obvious constraints listed below; several of them are load-bearing and were paid for with real bugs.

## Commands

```bash
python main.py                      # botni ishga tushirish (polling)
python tests/test_memory.py         # bitta testni ishga tushirish
python services/sandbox.py          # sandbox izolyatsiyasini tekshirish
python services/sandbox_helpers/deck.py   # PPTX maketlarini tekshirish
python tests/test_tts_lang.py --live  # jonli TTS sintezi bilan
```

No test framework, no linter, no build step. Each `tests/test_*.py` is a standalone `assert`-based script with numbered `print("[N] ... OK")` lines and a final summary. New tests follow that shape. On Windows, prefix with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` — some tests print emoji and the console codepage will otherwise raise `UnicodeEncodeError` (a false failure, not a real one).

Run the whole suite by looping over `tests/test_*.py`; `test_pro_security.py` is the slow one.

## Deploy

Railway, project `amused-endurance`, service `bot`. **This Railway account has no GitHub connection**, which has two consequences:

- `git push` does *not* trigger a deploy.
- A plain deploy call rebuilds the snapshot taken when the service was created, i.e. old code.

Deploys must name the commit explicitly via the Railway GraphQL API:
`serviceInstanceDeployV2(serviceId, environmentId, commitSha)` against `https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2` with a team token. The repo `afiffamily/1` is public, so Railway fetches it without GitHub auth. The `up` endpoint (local tarball upload) fails on this account. Connecting GitHub in Railway settings would remove all of this.

## Architecture

### Handler registration order is a safety constraint

`main.py` registers handlers in a deliberate order and each position is justified in a comment. The critical ones:

1. `successful_payment` / `pre_checkout_query` go on `dp.message` **directly**, before any router. `handlers/messages.py` has a `GeneratingState.generating` spam-guard with no content filter; if a payment lands while a reply is streaming, that guard would swallow it — money taken, Pro not granted.
2. FSM states (gift, promo, digest, broadcast) come before the AI handlers so a user's answer to "kimga sovg'a qilay?" is not sent to GPT as a question.
3. `maintenance_gate` sits before the AI handlers but after `/start` and `/profile`; `/pro`, `/promo`, `/gift` sit *after* it — selling a subscription for a disabled bot is a refund source.
4. `generating_state_router` is included before `general_router` so a message arriving mid-reply does not start a second parallel request.

Do not reorder these without reading the comments.

### The stop button needs two things aiogram won't do for you

`sendRichMessageDraft(can_stop=True)` makes Telegram send a `stopped_message_generation` update. aiogram 3.29 does not know that update type — `Update.event_type` raises on it — so it is caught in a `dp.update.outer_middleware` in `main.py` (middlewares run before `event_type` is resolved; the raw field survives because aiogram models are `extra="allow"`). It maps `draft_id` → `handlers.messages.request_stop()`.

`start_polling` must also be given `allowed_updates` **explicitly**: aiogram derives that list from registered handlers, and there is no handler for this type, so Telegram would never send the update at all — the button would fail silently.

Drafts are private-chat-only (API limit); `sendRichMessage` is not. `process_stream_draft` keeps those two as separate flags (`using_rich_draft` vs `can_send_rich`) — merging them again would strip tables, collapsed sources and images from every group answer.

### The tool loop (`services/ai.py`)

`get_openai_reply()` streams from the Responses API and runs a tool loop with **per-tool round budgets** (`MAX_SEARCH_ROUNDS`, `MAX_FILE_ROUNDS`, `MAX_IMAGE_ROUNDS`, `MAX_MEMORY_ROUNDS`, `MAX_REMINDER_ROUNDS`, plus `MAX_TOTAL_ROUNDS`). When a budget is spent the tool is dropped from `active_tools`, forcing the model to answer.

Tools: `internet_search`, `run_python_sandbox`, `generate_image`, `update_memory`, `manage_reminder`.

**Dispatch order matters**: the `else` branch routes any unknown tool name to web search, so every named tool must be an `elif` *above* it — otherwise "menga rasm chiz" silently becomes a DuckDuckGo query.

**Pro gating is done by omission**: `image_enabled = ... and is_pro`, `reminder_enabled = is_pro and user_id is not None`. Free users never see the schema, so no tokens are spent advertising a tool they cannot use. Flipping a feature to free-with-upsell means removing `is_pro` from that condition; the task functions already validate independently.

`get_vision_reply()` is a **separate, single-round** path — the memory tool call is harvested after the stream and its result is not fed back. Adding a full loop there means porting the `pending_calls` block.

`[CLEAR_TEXT]` travels through the same chunk stream as content and is emitted **after every** tool round, throwing away the model's pre-tool chatter so it doesn't stick to the final answer. The condition used to exclude repeat searches, and the leftover text then glued itself to the next round's — users saw two "…tayyorlayapman" sentences in one message. Reaching that point already means a tool ran (`if not got_function_call: return` above it), so no condition is needed.

While a file is being built the screen shows **only the status animation** — nothing the model wrote before the tool call reaches the user. Sending that preamble as an interim message was tried and reverted: it left a half-drawn draft bubble next to the real one, and the abandoned draft killed the spinner for the whole 1-2 minute wait. If you try it again, the draft must be overwritten or closed before a real message is sent, not simply replaced with a new `draft_id`.

### Photos: two separate pipelines that must not be confused

A photo in a **chat reply** and a photo **inside a document** share nothing but the search call, and mixing them up is the failure mode users actually hit.

- **In chat**: `internet_search(want_images=true)` searches, validates each URL is live, and stores the hits in `images_out`. The URL is deliberately **never shown to the model** — it costs 30-60 tokens each and the model rewrites them into dead links. The model only sees `[rasm:1]` / `[rasmlar]` tokens (~25 tokens total); `embed_images()` swaps them for real media blocks just before sending, and `strip_image_tokens()` scrubs them from every fallback path and from the streaming draft. Telegram fetches the URL itself — nothing is downloaded.
- **In a document**: see the Sandbox section. Bytes, not URLs.

The routing between them is prompt-level and fragile: adding the word "rasm" to the file tool's description was enough to make *every* request ("olma haqida ma'lumot ber") turn into a file task. Both tool descriptions now carry an explicit ⛔️ pointing at the other one, and `IMAGE_CAPABILITY_NOTE` in the system prompt exists because the model would otherwise answer "I can't send pictures" without calling any tool at all. That note is added **only** in `get_openai_reply` — `get_vision_reply` has no search tool, so promising it there would be a lie.

Image search runs with `safesearch="on"` (`SEARCH_IMAGE_SAFESEARCH`); the library default `moderate` was not enough for a bot with no age gate.

### A failed send is not the same as a rejected send

`_telegram_api_request` reports *why* a call failed through an `outcome` out-param: `OUTCOME_REJECTED` (Telegram answered `ok:false`) versus `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` (timeout, connection reset). The rich-message fallback ladder retries in a plainer form **only** on REJECTED. On UNKNOWN it gives up silently, because the message may well have arrived.

This exists because the shared aiohttp session caps every call at 10s — right for the 0.6s draft pings it was tuned for, wrong for a rich message carrying image URLs, since Telegram fetches each image from the source site before it creates the message. The client timed out, the ladder concluded "rejected", re-sent without images, and Telegram delivered both: users saw the same answer twice, once with photos and once without. Media sends now get `RICH_MEDIA_TIMEOUT` instead.

### Prompt caching constrains where text goes

`build_system_prompt()` is written to day precision so the prefix is identical all day and prompt caching works. Anything per-user (long-term memory, the user's name) goes into `messages` as a `developer` message, **never** into `instructions`. Putting user-specific text in the system prompt silently destroys the cache for everyone.

### Model list is a billing guard

`GPT_MODEL` and `MODEL_FALLBACKS` must stay inside OpenAI's free data-sharing list. A model outside it bills at full price and nothing warns you — the bill arrives at month end. `tests/test_free_models.py` guards this.

### Quotas: two independent systems

- **Points** (`check_and_consume_quota`) — the daily budget; cost varies by message kind and reasoning effort (`message_cost()`).
- **Daily counters** (`DAILY_COUNTERS` → `check_and_consume_daily`) — separate counts for `files`, `images`, `research`. These are the expensive operations; billing them to the points budget meant three files exhausted a user's whole day and read as "the bot broke".

`services/file_task_quota.py::DailyQuota` charges **once** per user request no matter how many times the model calls the tool, and refunds if nothing was produced.

`unlimited=True` means "nothing was deducted, do not refund" (admin/premium). Returning it for Pro would break every refund guard — `tests/test_plan_limits.py` asserts this.

Adding a new counter = one row in `DAILY_COUNTERS` + two DB columns. Nothing else.

### Model output is an untrusted boundary

Whatever the model writes into a tool call reaches the database. Validation lives in `db/database.py`, never in the tool `description` — an instruction is not a guarantee:

- `clean_memory()` strips newlines (a multi-line memory renders as fake instructions in the developer message) and rejects card/passport/account number patterns.
- `parse_run_at()` rejects past times, unparseable strings and dates beyond `REMINDER_MAX_AHEAD_DAYS`.
- Every `UPDATE`/`DELETE` driven by a model-supplied index carries `AND user_id = $N`; the index is bounds-checked against the list actually shown to the model *before* touching the DB (note `isinstance(idx, bool)` — `True` is an `int` in Python).

### Two kinds of memory

- **Conversation history** (`db/history.py`, `chat_messages` table + RAM cache) — context. Stored to `CONTEXT_WINDOW_PRO` for everyone; the tariff only changes how many are *read* (free 50, Pro 150), so switching plans needs no migration. `/new` clears this.
- **Long-term memory** (`user_memories`) — facts the model chose to keep, category-prefixed (`ism:`, `kasb:`, …). Survives `/new`. Available on every tariff.

History used to live in SQLite; Railway wipes the container filesystem on every deploy, so each deploy reset every user's context. It is Postgres now — do not move it back to a file.

### Guest mode

`handlers/guest.py` handles chats outside DMs via `guest_message`. It passes `caller_user_id` as **both** `chat_id` and `user_id`, so a person has one identity and one memory whether they write in a group or in the DM. Quota is charged to that user. Reminders are delivered to the DM regardless of where they were created.

### Activity types must be registered twice

Anything written to `user_activity` must also appear in the SQL filter and `type_labels` in `handlers/admin.py`, or it silently vanishes from admin statistics. `tests/test_activity_tracking.py` guards this.

### Inline button styles

Telegram accepts only `primary` / `success` / `danger` on a real `InlineKeyboardButton`. Any other value is rejected and **the whole message fails to send**. Use `pro_module.btn()` and the `BTN_*` constants. Where delivery matters, build a plain fallback keyboard too — `pro.send_rich()` degrades progressively, and the broadcast sender switches the entire run to plain on the first rejection.

`BTN_LINK` ("link") is the exception: it exists only for `<tg-button>` **inside a rich message** and only on callback buttons. `btn()` deliberately does not accept it.

`btn(disabled=True)` (Bot API 10.3) renders a visible but dead button. `disabled` **is** the button's type field, so `callback_data`/`url` must not be sent with it — and `_downgrade_kb()` has to carry it through, otherwise the fallback keyboard produces a typeless button and the whole message is rejected.

Buttons can also live inside the message body via `pro_module.rich_button()` / `rich_button_row()` (`<tg-button-row>`, 1-8 per row). These are HTML in the `markdown` field, so their text must be escaped — the builders do it. Escaping quotes is not enough: `html.escape()` leaves newlines alone, and a raw newline inside an attribute makes Telegram's parser cut the tag off there and print the rest as literal text. `_attr_value()` turns them into `&#10;`, which the client resolves back to a real newline when the value is used — that is what makes "copy" work on a multi-line snippet.

### The command menu is decoration, not a gate

`services/menu.py` sets the `/` list per chat (`BotCommandScopeChat`), so Pro
commands appear on purchase and vanish when the plan lapses. The free list is
set once at startup for all private chats; the per-chat scope overrides it,
which is why `/start` needs no extra DB read.

The menu can always be stale — a user can type `/kunlik` without opening it, and
expiry is only detected on the user's next message. The real check stays in the
handler. Adding a Pro command = one row in `PRO_COMMANDS`; `tests/test_menu.py`
asserts every listed command is actually registered.

### Telegram limits worth knowing here

- Bot API cannot download files larger than 20 MB — that is why `DOCUMENT_MAX_SIZE_PRO` is 20 MB and not higher.
- `XTR` invoice amounts are the star count directly, **not** multiplied by 100. `tests/test_pro_payload.py` locks this.

### Sandbox

`services/sandbox.py` runs model-written Python with a scrubbed environment (no `BOT_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`), a fresh temp cwd, a 60s timeout and RLIMITs on Linux. **Network is not blocked** — Railway offers no container isolation; the mitigation is that there are no secrets to steal and the timeout caps abuse.

`services/sandbox_helpers/` must stay next to `sandbox.py`; it is located via `Path(__file__).parent` and copied into each run.

Both helpers there exist for the same reason: the model composes documents by hardcoding coordinates and never measures what it placed. `docgen` owns text metrics for PDF; `deck` owns slide geometry for PPTX (safe margins, aspect-preserving image fit, a reserved footer band, a reserved caption line for image credit). Before `deck`, the three failures were always the same — picture over text, credit over picture, page number over picture. The tool description makes `deck` mandatory for PPTX and explicitly scopes the older manual-layout rules to PDF/DOCX/XLSX, because two sets of layout instructions produce worse output than one. `tests/test_deck_layout.py` asserts no two content shapes intersect — it already caught a 0.1" clash between the section number and its heading.

`deck` also owns image *placement*, not just geometry: `Deck(images=[...])` is a pool and every layout's `image` defaults to the `AUTO` sentinel, so photos spread across the whole deck. This exists because the model reads "put a picture on the first slide" literally and leaves every other slide bare. `image=None` is the explicit opt-out — that is why `AUTO` cannot simply be `None`. Side-by-side layouts put text and picture in frames of identical size and top, the picture cover-cropped to fill its frame exactly, so image scale never wanders between slides. `image_slide` is the opposite case — cropping a map or a chart destroys it — so there the picture is fitted whole and the card is then shrunk to hug it with fixed padding; the box it is given is only a bound, never the drawn frame. Caption and credit are positioned off the returned rect, not off that bound.

The tool description promises the model there is **no internet** inside the sandbox, and that promise is what makes generated code deterministic — a model asked to fetch a photo invents a URL, and invented URLs are dead. So photos for documents arrive the other way round: the model lists what it needs in `image_queries`, `_run_file_task` downloads and converts them **before** the run, and `run_in_sandbox(extra_files=...)` drops them in the work dir as `rasm1.jpg`, `rasm2.jpg` — positional, one per query, a missing one still burns its number so the rest don't shift. They are cached per user request, because the file loop reruns up to 4 times and a second download would hand the model *different* photos than the caption it already wrote. Everything is re-encoded to JPEG via Pillow: most DuckDuckGo image results are WEBP and python-pptx rejects WEBP.

## Other agent configs

A Codex config exists at `~/.codex/config.toml`. Reply `/import` to scan and list what is importable (MCP servers, slash commands, subagents, skills, instructions), then `/import --yes=<digest>` — the scan output names the digest — to apply the user-level items.
